TODO:
Measure current consumption of device
Add shield/earth ground plane
Add ESD Diodes & improve EMC
Remove some decoupling on USB input
Improve programmer to include DTR signal and JTAG (aka upgrade from FT230X)
Look into making board 4 layers

Maybe:
USB A connector
Look into USB C
Remove wifi, use ESP32 instead of ESP32-WROOM

Someday:
Change to Linux platform using I.MX 6ULLY7DVM09AA with PHY, or I.MX 6ULZ with ethernet controller
